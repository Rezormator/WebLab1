        <p>Stephen Curry won back-to-back NBA MVP awards in 2015 and 2016, cementing his place as one of the league's greatest players. In the 2014-2015 season, he averaged 23.8 points, 7.7 assists, and 4.3 rebounds per game, leading the Golden State Warriors to a 67-15 record and their first championship in 40 years. His exceptional shooting, especially from beyond the arc, revolutionized the game and led to what many call the "three-point revolution." In 2015-2016, Curry elevated his game, averaging 30.1 points, 6.7 assists, and 5.4 rebounds per game, becoming the first player to make over 400 three-pointers in a season. He made history as the NBA's first-ever unanimous MVP, guiding the Warriors to a record-breaking 73-9 regular-season record. Despite falling short in the NBA Finals that year, Curryâ€™s influence on the game became undeniable, redefining modern basketball with his long-range shooting and dynamic playmaking.</p>
