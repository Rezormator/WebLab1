        <p>The 2017 Golden State Warriors were a powerhouse, finishing the season with a 67-15 record and winning the NBA Championship. With Stephen Curry leading the charge, they had an incredible roster. Here's a look at the key players from that squad:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Stephen Curry - Known for his incredible shooting and ball-handling skills, Curry was the leader of this team.</li>
            <li>Kevin Durant - Acquired before the 2016-2017 season, Durant was a game-changing addition, providing scoring and defense.</li>
            <li>Klay Thompson - Curry’s backcourt partner, Thompson was known for his scoring ability and defensive prowess.</li>
            <li>Draymond Green - The team’s defensive anchor and playmaker, Green contributed significantly in multiple facets of the game.</li>
            <li>Andre Iguodala - Though not a starter, Iguodala played a crucial role off the bench, providing defense and playmaking.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The 2017 Warriors also had strong support from players like Shaun Livingston, David West, and Zaza Pachulia. The combination of Curry’s shooting, Durant’s scoring, Thompson’s defense, and Green’s all-around game made them an incredibly tough team to beat.</p>
