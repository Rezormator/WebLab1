        <p>Stephen Curry is a four-time NBA champion, having led the Golden State Warriors to titles in 2015, 2017, 2018, and 2022. In 2015, he guided the Warriors to their first championship in 40 years, defeating the Cleveland Cavaliers 4-2. Curry's exceptional shooting redefined the game, setting the stage for a Warriors dynasty. In 2017 and 2018, with the addition of Kevin Durant, the Warriors secured back-to-back titles, defeating the Cavaliers again, with Curry playing a key role in both victories. In 2022, after overcoming injuries and roster changes, Curry led the Warriors to their fourth title, this time against the Boston Celtics. He was named NBA Finals MVP for the first time, averaging 31.2 points per game. These championships solidified Curry's legacy as one of the greatest players in NBA history and a transformative figure in modern basketball.</p>
