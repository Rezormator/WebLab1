        <p>Stephen Curry attended Davidson College in North Carolina from 2006 to 2009. He made an immediate impact by setting the NCAA record for most three-pointers made by a freshman and leading the team to a Southern Conference championship and an NCAA Tournament appearance. In his sophomore season, Curry led Davidson to the Elite Eight of the NCAA Tournament and became a national sensation. His scoring prowess and leadership were instrumental in the team's success. During his junior year, Curry transitioned to the point guard position and led the nation in scoring, breaking several records in the process. His performance solidified his reputation as a top NBA prospect. Curry declared for the 2009 NBA Draft after his junior year and was selected 7th overall by the Golden State Warriors. Davidson College later retired his jersey number 30 in honor of his contributions. In 2022, Curry returned to Davidson to complete his degree in Sociology.</p>
