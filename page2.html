        <p>Stephen Curry's early NBA career began when he was drafted by the Golden State Warriors as the 7th overall pick in the 2009 NBA Draft. In his rookie season (2009-2010), he made an immediate impact, averaging 17.5 points and 5.9 assists per game, and earning a spot on the NBA All-Rookie First Team. One of his standout performances was scoring 54 points against the New York Knicks in February 2010, demonstrating his exceptional shooting ability. However, his early years were also marked by injury struggles, particularly with his ankles, which required multiple surgeries and caused him to miss several games. Despite these challenges, Curry's potential was evident, and he began to develop into a key playmaker for the Warriors. His shooting skills and style of play were already reshaping the team's approach, setting the stage for his future success and impact on the game.</p>
